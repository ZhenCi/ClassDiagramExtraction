1   Overwriting existent files
The current version (as of April 13, 2019) stores all submitted files
in a single folder called Lab_Report_Submisions.
In case two submissions have the same name, the older
one would be overwritten by the new one, causing information loss.
For example, if student s1 submitted a file called code.txt at t1 and student s2 submitted a file with the same file name at t2 > t1, then s2's code.txt will replace s1's code.txt, resulting a total information loss for s1.

8   Feedback does not show properly in a student's account
Created attachment 1 [details]
Feedback for other students' work is displayed
When a student checks the feedback of his submitted lab report/assignment, a list of all other students (with or without feedback) will be displayed.
This does not make too much sense as he is supposed to only see the feedback relevant to his work (but not others' work).

9   A student could not see his lab report after submitting it
The student should be able to see his own work in his account after he submitted it.   The benefits of having this is two-folds.
- Be reassured that he has successfully submitted his work.
- Access his own work in the future through.

Please show "submitted by whom" information below submission date, e.g, "Submitted: 2019-10-14 23:00:00", for each submission.
Why is the "submitted by whom" information important?  It is important because it let me quickly know who submitted the work.   Many groups won't put member information in the title.  We should not expect that they would do that.

32   Downloading remote css slows things down
LRR depends on a font-awesome stylesheet from a remote place, i.e., cloudflare.
https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.8.2/css/all.min.css
This greatly slows down page loading.  I experienced noticeable delay.  Not great user experience.
It would be great if the stylesheet could be stored in the local server.

34   Make group information more readable with better organization

It is a bit hard for first-time user to figure out group information.

43   Enable the instructor to upload a class list
The following functionality, described using User Story, might be handy.
As an instructor,
I want to upload a class list for my course,
so that I could download from LRR a spreadsheet (in CSV format) containing the
score for all students and for all assignments.
More details about the class list:
- The class list is plain text file with two columns separated by TABs.
- The two columns are student numner and student name.
- No header line.
More details about the output.
- It is a Comma Separated Value file.
- File name should be the CourseCode + CourseName + Semester + SectionName (if any) + InstructorName.csv
- Rows are in the same order as that in the class list.
- The value for a no submission should be NA.  Not 0.

20   Submissions not sorted in descending order of update time
It would be great if submissions could be ordered in descending order of update time, such that the most recent submission is on the top, and the earliest submission is on the bottom.

35   Make Lab Report Assignment names editable
Created attachment 18 [details]
Assignment names should be editable after being created
I would be a great addition that I could edit assignment names.  Is adding an Edit button beside the yellow box a good idea?  See the attached figure.
Why do I need this?  Because I made mistakes on the assignment name. I meant "Lab3 - Same day submission" instead of "Lab2 - Same day submission".  If I could not change that, this would cause confusion among students.

So for these guys , they have to reset their password first.
I will fix this ASAP , next two days.

Failed to update an attached file in a new assignment
I (as an instructor) posted a new assignment in course (CSC322) - Software Project Management, titled ExamAnswerSubmission-Makeup (Individual).
I attached two files, StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt and ExamInstructions.txt.
I found an error in StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt, i.e., "ExamAnswerSubmission-ExamAnswerSubmission-Makeup" where "ExamAnswerSubmission" had been repeated twice.
Therefore, I tried to replace the old  StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt with a new , correct one by clicking the Edit link and uploading a new StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt again.  But I failed -- StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt remained the same.

175   A student who already joined the course could not see the posted assignment
A student who has already joined the course (course code CSC340) could not see the posted assignment, while he was still before the deadline.
This bug was reported by Wang Zhiyang.
The bug was caused by Course.php.  $group_id in it was not properly set if the student does not belong to a group.  So we see an SQL statement like below was constructed.
select Lab_Report_ID from lab_report_submissions where (Student_id=201830220719 or Course_Group_id=)
Note that "Course_Group_id=)" could cause an SQL syntax error.
So add the following check after $group_id is altered.
$group_id=$_SESSION['group_id'];
if($group_id==""){$group_id=-1;}

Afer I clicked the "Mark Submission" button, I saw this prompt:

See the attached picture for more detail.

178   Students cannot see the posted assignment even it is before the deadline
For example, if the deadline is 23:59 on 2020-09-28 , then students are unable to see the posted assignment on 2020-09-28.
The problem is caused by a wrong Deadline string in the database table lab_reports_table, "2020-09-28   23:59".  Notice that there are two extra spaces between "2020-09-30" and "23:59".   Consequently, even "2020-09-28 00:01" becomes greater than "2020-09-28   23:59", because '0' is greater than a space in the ASCII table.
This is possibly a regression bug after adding this functionality: allowing Lecturer to edit assignment information.  For more details, see the following Pull Request: https://github.com/lanlab-org/LRR/pull/21

197   Any account can be easily sabotaged
Overview:
This might be the most critical bug ever produced in LRR.
If this bug to happen actually in a commercial software, it would cause the business millions if not billions of dollars.
And that system would get shutdown immediately.
I'm not sure whether I can call this a bug or a security flaw/breach.
The problem as the title suggests, anyone in anytime can sabotage any account in LRR as long as they can provide the target's email and student ID.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Click on "Reset my password" under "Login" button in LRR's homepage.
2) Enter the targeted student's email and ID.
3) Click "Recover".
4) You will see a password reset successfully message, and it will ask you to go Sign up again.
5) On the homepage, enter the target student ID in the signup form, and click "Next".
6) Enter the target new information which includes his new password.
7) Congrats you just have hacked someone.
Expected result:
The target should receive an email message with a link to reset his password by himself.
Actual result:
The target's account has been sabotaged.
Additional information:
I couldn't find the right term for this bug on the severity list, so I would like to propose a new exclusive term: "Disaster"

24   Need a better directory structure when storing students' assignments
Created attachment 10 [details]
directory structure needs improvement
Currently we use the following directory structure to store a student's assignment submissions (e.g., see the attached picture):
/student-number/assignment-title/assignment-submission.zip
This structure is fine if the student takes only one course. But if he took multiple courses that have the same assignment-title, then there is a potential conflict.
To avoid this, we could either use
/student-number/course-code/assignment-title_assignement-id/assignment-submission.zip
or use
/student-number/course-code/semester/assignment-submission.zip
Which one is better?

Created attachment 33 [details]
The Current Sign up Form
Perhaps we should hide "Your Passport / National ID" input box (see the attached picture).
Why?
Because it is rarely used and it asks people to enter a long number that they do not usually remember.
Why did we make this input box?  The reason was that we were afraid that someone else (not the student himself) could sign up, which makes the real student unable to sign up.
This never happens.
For simplicity, I would suggest to hide (remove) this input box.

It would be convenient if we could download all submissions as a zip file.
This option could be very useful when we are marking programming assignments, or
when we are archiving submissions for a particular assignment.
Otherwise, we have to download one by one, which is painfully inefficient if we have hundreds of assignments (the more the worse).
What do you think?

29   Typo in the project homepage

37   The Website is not mobile friendly
Created attachment 20 [details]
how the website looks on iphone5
When a device with a small screen (eg: iPhone 5 ) is used to visit the website, the website appears small very small and the user needs to zoom it in order to use it.
As modern websites, the LRR's website also should scale to fit the size of the screen

38   Home page still have Login form even when the user is logg ed in
It is confusing when the user sees a login screen when he/she has already logged in.
I suggest that the homepage displays other contents instead of a login and signup page

40   Missing a submitted group lab report after accepting invitation to join group before deadline.
Created attachment 22 [details]
screenshot of accepted invitations and missed lab.
A student was invited into a group severally by the group leader. After accepting all invitations, the student's details are expected to feature under the group.
The group leader submitted the assignment, the invited student's details didn't appear.
After the deadline, the student's missed lab report tab showed he missed the submission.
 Screenshot attached.

45   Log in Data Form incoherence

The bug report on a Pdf file
The bug is as follow: I should log in as a student not as a lecturer because the form student sign-up and sign in both belong to a student not to the lecturer, to be able to log in as a lecturer I should have the form sign in for the lecturer.
This is actually not a big concern.  Because the system
could tell different roles based on different account names.
I think it is simpler to have a single place to login, both for students,
for instructors and for teaching assistants.

46   The Sign in form and the Sign up form Should be in the same login user data form

48   Resetting password does not send resetting link
Same here. I am unable to recover password password with my outlook.com email account.
Even worse, I am unable to sign in again immediately after I sign up.
Same here. I am unable to recover password password with my outlook.com email account.
Even worse, I am unable to sign in again immediately after I sign up.
THIS IS A REALLY SERIOUS BUG AND MUST BE FIXED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
If a user could not log in again, this is the best way to drive away users!

54   Group creation error on duplicated group names

Group Creation Error
Marie was unable to create "group 2".
See the attached picture the error message.
She created "group 2" before.
When she tried to create a group with the same name, she failed badly.
Yes, she should fail, but we should not expose the SQL statements.
Say some thing more friendly.

58   Course number information
Sir i want to improve the LLR search for course
(Is not working right) if you don’t have the course number is impossible to find the course . I think that should be change .
It should be easy to search for course and add it without courses number.
-FADHEL ABDULLAH
 Yes, that is a great point.  Currently, the instructor needs to announce the course number before students can join.  Not very convenient, is it?  Idally, the student should be presented with a full list of courses offered in the current semester.  (There might be a problem of too much information if it is a big unversity offering hundreds of courses.)  Add a course search functionality?  For example, people could search a course by key words, by instructor name, by department, etc.  Is it worth the trouble?  We could search on one big list using Ctrl+F.

61   We cant submit assignment to LRR

75   Assignment attachments storage path may cause overwriting
FOLDER STRUCTURE CAN CAUSE FILE OVERWRTITING
StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt is stored in a folder called ExamAnswerSubmission-Makeup, as is evident from the following URL:
http://118.25.96.118/nor/Lab_Report_Assignments//ExamAnswerSubmission-Makeup/StudentNumber-AnswerSheet.txt
One potential problem is that if two courses use the same assignment name "ExamAnswerSubmission-Makeup", then two courses will share the same folder.
Even worse, if two courses use the same attachment file name, then one will be overwritten by another, whoever comes earlier.
By the same reasoning, we also need to double check that a student's submission won't be overwritten by another student's submission.

unable to edit the remarking reason
While checking the mark of my previous assignment, I found the feedback from the instructor asking me to explain a sentence. I clicked the button to submit my answer and a small tab having two-button ("ENTER" and "CANCEL") and an answer text area shows up. I clicked the CANCEL button without writing anything in the answer text area and I got the following result(see attachment) with no possibility to change the answer.

211   URL field under "create portal" in "admin" page does not allow blank values as it suggests.
Overview:
When creating a course portal in admin page, if you leave the "URL (Leave blank to use Course Name)" field blank, the system does not allow you to create portal until you type a course URL. Although the field name suggests that leaving it blank the course name should be used instead.
Steps to reproduce:
1- Login as a lecturer.
2- Go to "Admin" page from the header.
3- Under "Create new Portal", fill all fields and leave "URL (Leave blank to use Course Name)" field blank.
4- Click "Create Portal" button.
Expected result:
The system creates course portal successfully.
Actuall result:
The system alerts you to fill in the field "URL (Leave blank to use Course Name)".
Additional information:
None.
