You will develop a vehicle brain as well as a central brain that would enable autonomous vehicles to run smoothly on a
road. For simplicity, assume that the road has only two lanes, one southbound and another northbound. Also, assume that
a vehicle could only go in one direction. A southbound vehicle therefore will not have a collision with a northbound
vehicle even if their distance is 0. The vehicle brain will be installed on each autonomous vehicle, and the central
brain will be installed on a cloud server. Each autonomous vehicle knows its destination. The vehicle brain keeps asking
the following three questions: “where am I?” “what is around me?” and “what should I do next?”. Each autonomous vehicle
knows its current position, speed, and direction. Each autonomous vehicle must be able to communicate with nearby autonomous
vehicles. Each autonomous vehicle can speed up, slow down, or pull the emergency brake, to achieve maximum safety.
The central brain obtains the movement information of all autonomous vehicles on the road and broadcasts road conditions
(e.g., traffic jams) to all vehicles running on the road.
