Rationale
  - For reducing paperwork.  Students don't have to submit their work
    in person, saving a lot of trouble in bad weather.
  - For archiving, for searchability and for publicity.
  - For reducing the missing rate.  From my experience, I could miss
    2% of email-based submissions in my first round of marking.  When
    there are hundreds of submissions, it is easy to ignore a few
    submissions, either because of vague email subject from the
    student side or because of inevitable human error from my side.
Functional requirements
- Report accessibility: public or private (visible after N days).
  - The content of lab reports should NOT be visible to other students before the deadline (or before the extended deadline). But submission status can be made public.
  - Do we want to make the reports available to future students taking the same course?
  - Do we want to make the reports publicly accessible after a certain period?
  - How to maximize flexibility when controlling accessibility.
- For each lab report, instructors set a deadline or grant a deadline extension for sick students.
- Instructors give feedback (what forms of feedback do we plan to have?).  Students check feedback.  Should instructors and TAs have the same privileges?
- Students request remarking (if any).
- The administrator creates accounts & sets initial passwords.  What information does he need?  How does he distribute user names and passwords?
- The administrator suspends/deletes accounts.
- Consider other application areas when designing. For example, a blood-test lab in a hospital might also find this application useful.  Make code reusable.
- Use your favourite programming language.
- Database: SQLite (recommended).  How many database tables and what columns to include?

- [New & Must have] Course portal.  Use course portal to simplify course
  management.  The instructor can create a course portal, with a
  sensible http address, e.g., .../InstructorLastName-CourseName-Semester-Section (Trump-DealArt-Fall2018-Section1).
  This address format is recommended but not required.  The instructor
  can use any portal name as long as the name has not been taken.
- [New & Won't have (optional)] Team creation.  Students often do labs
  in groups.  We should allow them to form teams.  The team
  information (user names, real names and student numbers) is included
  in each lab report submission.
- [New & Must have] There must be a marking status associated to each submitted
  lab report.  By default, the marking status is PENDING (preferably
  shown in red).  The instructor/TA can change the status to FINISHED
  (preferably shown in green) when done.  It is desirable to show the
  text PENDING and FINISHED in different colours, which helps us
  quickly identify not-yet-marked (or marked) reports from a list of
  many submissions.  [Added on 19 December 2018]
- [New & Should have] Click Minimalism.  We prefer to finish a task in
  a most straightforward manner that requires minimum number of
  mouse clicks.  Therefore make sure the LRR minimalises the number of
  clicks required for the most frequently used features (e.g.,
  submitting a lab report to a destination in LRR).  Check the
  Three-click rule.  [Added on 19 December 2018]
Main roles
- Students, instructors, TAs, administrators, and visitors.
